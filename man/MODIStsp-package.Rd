\title{MODIStsp: a package to automatize the creation of time series of raster
images derived from MODIS Land Products}
\description{
MODIStsp allows automating the creation of time series of rasters derived
from MODIS Satellite Land Products data. It performs several typical
preprocessing steps such as download, mosaicking, reprojection and resize
of data acquired on a specified time period. All processing parameters
can be set using a user-friendly GUI. Users can select which layers of
the original MODIS HDF files they want to process, which additional
Quality Indicators should be extracted from aggregated MODIS Quality
Assurance layers and, in the case of Surface Reflectance products
, which Spectral Indexes should be computed from the original reflectance
bands. For each output layer, outputs are saved as single-band raster
files corresponding to each available acquisition date. Virtual files
allowing access to the entire time series as a single file are also created.
Command-line execution exploiting a previously saved processing options
file is also possible, allowing to automatically update time series
related to a MODIS product whenever a new image is available.

Output raster files are saved in specific subfolders of the main output folder. 
In particular, **a separate subfolder** is created for each processed original 
MODIS layer, Quality Indicator or Spectral Index. Each subfolder contains one image
for each processed date, created according to the following naming conventions: 

```
myoutfolder/"ProdName"/"Layer"/"ProdCode"_"Layer"_"YYYY"_"DOY"."ext"
```

, where: 

  - **_ProdName_** is a short name describing the MODIS product from which the 
    datasets were derived (e.g., VI_16Days_1Km_v6);
  - **_Layer_** is a short name describing the dataset (e.g., b1_Red, NDII, UI);
  - **_ProdCode_** is the code name of the MODIS product from which the image was
  derived (e.g., MOD13Q1 - Note that if you choose to process both "Terra" and 
    "Aqua" data, data coming from either platform will be placed in the same folder
    and you will have for example both "MOD13Q1..." and "MYD13Q1..." files in the 
    output folder);
  - **_YYYY_** and **_DOY_** correspond to the year and DOY (Day of the Year) of 
  acquisition of the original MODIS image;
  - **_ext_** is the file extension (.tif for GTiff outputs, or .dat for ENVI outputs). 
  
So, for example, if you process layers "NDVI" and "EVI" for MODIS product MOD13A2 
you will find the resulting GTiff of ENVI output single-date rasters in:

```
/your_out_folder/VI_16Days_1Km_v6/NDVI/
```

and

```
/your_out_folder/VI_16Days_1Km_v6/EVI/
```

ENVI and/or GDAL virtual time series files and _RasterStack_ RData objects are 
instead stored **in the "Time\_Series" subfolder** if required.

Naming conventions for these files is as follow:

```
<path_of_out_folder>/Time_Series/<vrt_type>/<Sensor>/<Layer>/<ProdCode>_<Layer>_<StartDOY>_<StartYear>_<EndDOY>_<EndYear>_<suffix>.<ext> 
```

, where: 

  - `<vrt_type>` indicates the type of virtual file (`"RData"`, `"GDAL"` or `"ENVI_META"`);
  - `<Sensor>` indicates to which MODIS sensor the time series belongs (`"Terra"`,
  `"Aqua"`, `"Mixed"` or `"Combined"` (for MCD* products));
  - `<Layer>` is a short name describing the dataset (e.g., `"b1_Red"`, `"NDII"`, `"UI"`);
  - `<ProdCode>` is the code name of the MODIS product from which the image was 
  derived (e.g., `"MOD13Q1"`);
  - `<StartDOY>`, `<StartYear>`, `<EndDOY>` and `<EndYear>` indicate the 
  temporal extent of the time serie created; 
  - `<suffix>` indicates the type of virtual file (`"ENVI"`, `"GDAL"` or `"RData"`);
  - `<ext>` is the file extension (`".vrt"` for GDAL virtual files, `"META"` for 
  ENVI meta files or `"RData"` for `R` raster stacks). 

So, for example, if you process layer "NDVI" for MODIS product MOD13A2 and platform 
"Terra", and ask to create "R rasterStacks" and "GDAL vrt" time series you will 
find the resulting GTiff virtual files in:

```
/your_out_folder/VI_16Days_1Km_v6/Time_Series/RData/Terra/NDVI
```

and 

```
/your_out_folder/VI_16Days_1Km_v6/Time_Series/GDAL/Terra/NDVI
```

MODIStsp can be also executed as a "stand-alone" application (i.e., without having to open R/RStudio). 

To be able to do that, from R launch the function `install_MODIStsp_launcher()`.

- In a Linux operating system this function creates a desktop entry (accessible from the menu in the sections "Science" and "Geography") and a symbolic link in a known path (default: /usr/bin/MODIStsp).
- In Windows, a link in the Start Menu and optionally a desktop shortcut are created.
See `?install_MODIStsp_launcher` for details and path customization.

Double-clicking these files or launching them from a shell without parameters will launch `MODIStsp` in interactive mode, by opening the GUI. Non-interactive mode can be triggered by adding the "-g"  argument to the call, and specifying the path to a valid Options File as "-s" argument:

  - Linux: `MODIStsp -g -s "/yourpath/youroptions.json"`
  (see `MODIStsp -h` for details).
  
  - Windows:`your_r_library\MODIStsp\ExtData\Launcher\MODIStsp.bat -g -s "yourpath/youroptions.json"`
  (see `C:\Users\you\Desktop\MODIStsp -h` for details).

If you do not want to install any link, launchers can be found in the subdirectory "MODIStsp/ExtData/Launcher" of your library path.

Stand-alone non-interactive execution can be exploited to periodically and automatically update the time series of a selected product over a given study area. To do that, you should simply:

1.	Open the `MODIStsp` GUI, define the parameters of the processing specifying a date in the future as the "Ending Date" and save the processing options. Then quit the program.
 
2. Schedule non-interactive execution of the MODIStsp launcher script installed as seen before (or located in the subdirectory "MODIStsp/ExtData/Launcher" of your R library path) as a windows scheduled task or linux "cron" job according to a specified time schedule, specifying the path of a previously saved Options file as additional argument:

## _On Linux_

- edit your crontab by opening a terminal and typing:

```bash
  crontab -e
```
 
- add an entry for execution of MODIStsp launcher. For example, if you have installed it in /usr/bin and you want to run the tool every day at 23.00, add the following row:
        
```bash
  0 23 * * * /bin/bash /usr/bin/MODIStsp -g -s "/yourpath/youroptions.json"
```
      
## _On Windows_

- create a Task following [this instructions](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc748993.aspx)
- add the path of the MODIStsp.bat launcher as Action (point 6), specifying  `-g -s "X:/yourpath/youroptions.json"` as argument.
